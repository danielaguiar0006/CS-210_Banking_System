The build_and_run.bat file assumes a Windows environment with g++ installed. If 
you are using a different environment, you will need to modify the build_and_run.bat
file to work with your environment. You can also compile and run the program manually
using the following commands (again assuming you have g++ installed):
g++ -o Airgead_Banking main.cpp BankingSystem.cpp CalculationEngine.cpp
.\Airgead_Banking.exe
