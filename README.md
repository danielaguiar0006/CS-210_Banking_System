# Airgead Banking App - CS210 Banking System Project
## Description 
The Airgead Banking App offers a straightforward tool for visualizing
projected investment growth through compound interest, based on user-defined input
parameters. It efficiently demonstrates the effects of regular contributions and
varying interest rates on long-term savings. The approach taken for the code design
is object-oriented.
## Reflection
#### What did you do particularly well?
I belive that I did a good job implementing/maintaining the coding standards I was 
given and correctly implementing the features I was asked in a clear object oriented
manner. 

#### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There might be security issues that I'm not aware of but I did try my best
implementing error handling especially when dealing with user input, but I may have
missed issues like that. 

#### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging code to write was actually just implementing the calculation engine
funcitons because I was constantly messing up the calculation algorithms and they would
produce wrong results. I used whatever resource would pop up on google when searching
for the problem i was trying to solve and through some trial and error I got there!

#### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to correctly follow coding standards, writing up psuedocode,and  using a more 
object oriented approach for programs.

#### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I seperated my code into distinct functions that each had certain jobs, I wrote a lot of
comments, and I wrote documentation for each function in their respective decleration .h file
